<h1>Things I Learned In Unit 2</h1>

<h2>Which two websites am I most inspired by?</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.tankboys.biz/">Taknboys.biz</a></br>
		Type design with minimal graphics grabs my visual interest. Clean and simple.</li>

		<li><a href="http://10andthree.com/">10andthree.com</a></br>
		Grids that are not too fancy don't just highlight each element, but provides an overall visual theme to the entire site.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.tankboys.biz/">Taknboys.biz</a></br>
		The large type directs users' attention and leads them to discover the content by scrolling down. When mousing over the copy, you immediately learn about the functionality of each headline- which when allowed to be clicked, will automatically take you to a more descriptive page with an interesting transition.</li>

		<li><a href="http://10andthree.com/">10andthree.com</a></br>
		The focal point is simple and obvious, and implies the theme of the rest of the website. You're never overwhelmed nor confused with the content- it literally only allows you to view a couple of items at a time. Scroll, click, enjoy. Completely serves the purpose of this portfolio and doesn't try to be something it's not.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Similarities</h3></br>
		Both website have a sense of purpose and personality. Both showcase it's content through very direct and simple visual elements. Both utilize grids to drive the user experience.</li>

		<li><h3>Differences</h3></br>
		Even though both peak my visual interest, they both showcase different content. Tankboys actually gives its audience a choice of how to view it's content; the style doesn't change, but the contents can be toggled between images and text.</br>
		10andthree is simply a portfolio of stories told through photography and minimal blurb. No choosing, or toggling- just presenting itself in it's proud and bold design.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
